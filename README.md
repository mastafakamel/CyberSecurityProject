# CVE Vulnerability Checker for Project Libraries

## Overview

The **CVE Vulnerability Checker** is a Python script that scans a list of project dependencies and checks them against known vulnerabilities using the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API](https://nvd.nist.gov/). It helps developers and security engineers to identify vulnerable libraries and take action before issues impact production environments.

## Features

- **CVE Lookup:** Fetches real-time CVE data from NVD API.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Automatically scans a list of project libraries and identifies known vulnerabilities for the specific versions in use.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Outputs vulnerability information, including CVE ID, description, and affected versions.
- **Easy Integration:** Can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to automate vulnerability checking.

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mastafakamel/CyberSecurityProject.git
cd cve-vulnerability-checker
```

## Usage

### Example Configuration

To use the script, define your project's dependencies your project **[requirements.txt can]** and copy it next to  Folder Src

### Run the Script

To check for vulnerabilities, simply run the `cve_checker.py` script:

```bash
python cve_checker.py
```

The script will output the list of libraries affected by known CVEs, along with their descriptions and affected versions.

### Example Output

```bash
[!] requests 2.26.0 is affected by CVE-2023-0001
    CPE: cpe:2.3:a:requests:requests:2.26.0
    Description: Fake RCE in requests library
