# CVE Vulnerability Checker for Project Libraries

## Overview

The **CVE Vulnerability Checker** is a Python script that scans a list of project dependencies and checks them against known vulnerabilities using the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API](https://nvd.nist.gov/). It helps developers and security engineers to identify vulnerable libraries and take action before issues impact production environments.

## Features

- **CVE Lookup:** Fetches real-time CVE data from NVD API.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Automatically scans a list of project libraries and identifies known vulnerabilities for the specific versions in use.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Outputs vulnerability information, including CVE ID, description, and affected versions.
- **Easy Integration:** Can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to automate vulnerability checking.
